          Many Small Business Owners Struggle to Understand Their Own Numbers

              Most small and medium business owners keep track of their finances through spreadsheets or manual records.
              <br>
              They know their revenue and expenses, but they rarely understand what those numbers mean.<br>
              Thereâ€™s often no clear picture of how sales, profits, or branches actually perform over time.<br><br>

              Thatâ€™s where Finalytics comes in. It is a web-based finance dashboard powered by AI that helps users turn
              raw data like Profit & Loss (P&L) and sales targets into clear insights, showing trends in sales,
              products, and branch performance automatically.<br><br>

              I joined this project as a UI/UX Designer, responsible for creating wireframes and refining the dashboard
              layout to make data visualization simple, structured, and easy to interpret.

          <div class="list flex items-start">
            I began by translating the product idea into structured wireframes, defining how users would move between
            key sections like Sales, Profit & Loss, Products, and Branches.<br><br>

            The wireframes emphasized:<br>

            ðŸ‘‰ Hierarchy: Important metrics appear above secondary data.<br>

            ðŸ‘‰ Grouping: Related data sits together for faster scanning.<br>

            ðŸ‘‰ Scalability: The layout can expand as more insights are added later.<br><br>

            These wireframes became the blueprint that guided the development and visual design phases, ensuring
            consistency across the product.

          <div class="list flex items-start">
            Once the structure was approved, I refined the UI layout to enhance visual rhythm and usability.<br>
            My focus was on making every section look intentional, where alignment, spacing, and typography all help
            users process data faster.<br><br>

            Key improvements included:<br>

            ðŸ‘‰ Cleaning up chart areas for better focus on insights.<br>

            ðŸ‘‰ Simplifying navigation to reduce cognitive load.<br>

            ðŸ‘‰ Creating flexible card layouts that adapt to various data types.<br><br>

            The result was a dashboard that feels organized, modern, and easy to read even when displaying complex
            datasets.

            ðŸ‘‰ Maintain consistency across pages and data views.<br>

            ðŸ‘‰ Establish a scalable foundation for future AI-powered features.

          Reflection
        </h3>
        <div class="lists grid gap-12">
          <div class="list flex items-start">
            Working on Finalytics taught me how powerful information hierarchy can be in shaping how users understand
            data.<br>
            Even without visual polish, well-structured wireframes can define clarity and direction for an entire
            product.<br><br>

            Through this project, I strengthened my ability to:<br>

            ðŸ‘‰ Organize dense information into readable layouts.<br>

            ðŸ‘‰ Create functional wireframes that communicate logic clearly.<br>

            ðŸ‘‰ Refine interfaces where clarity and precision matter most.<br><br>

            This project reinforced an important principle for me: great design begins with structure.
            A clean layout doesnâ€™t just make an app look better, it helps users think better.
