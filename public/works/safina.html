                Most people start using finance apps with good intentions, but
                after a few weeks, they stop. Manually entering every expense
                feels repetitive, and the process quickly becomes a chore.
                <br />
                <br />
                Safina was created to change that habit. This mobile app helps
                users track their spending and income through simple
                conversations with an AI chatbot. By saying things like
                <br /><br />
                <span class="font-bold"
                  >‚ÄúI spent Rp25.000 on coffee this morning,‚Äù</span
                ><br /><br />
                the app automatically records and categorizes the
                transaction.<br /><br />
                As a UI/UX Designer, my role was to refine the user flow, design
                the interface, and ensure that the concept felt simple, natural,
                and engaging for everyday use.

            <div class="list flex items-start">
              Most finance apps focus on numbers and forms, not on how people
              naturally interact. Users often lose interest because the process
              of tracking feels like extra work. <br /><br />Safina‚Äôs goal is to
              make financial management feel effortless. Instead of navigating
              through multiple forms and buttons, users can communicate directly
              with the app using everyday language. The challenge was to design
              this conversational experience while keeping it functional, clear,
              and enjoyable to use.

            <div class="list flex items-start">
              Although I did not conduct formal surveys or usability testing, I
              studied several popular finance apps to understand where users
              typically drop off. Many apps make tracking too manual or too
              complex. <br /><br />
              From those insights, I focused on creating an experience that
              reduces friction, simplifies decision-making, and builds comfort
              through clarity. This direction guided how I approached the user
              journey, layout, and visual hierarchy.

            <div class="list flex items-start">
              When I joined the project, the concept and early flow already
              existed, but it needed refinement. I worked on clarifying how
              users would move through the app, from onboarding to chatting with
              the AI and reviewing their financial summaries.
              <br /><br />
              Each step was designed to feel continuous, as if the user is in
              one ongoing conversation rather than switching between different
              screens. This made the experience smoother and helped maintain a
              natural rhythm in how users interact with their finances.

          <div class="lists grid gap-12">
            <div class="list flex items-start">
              After refining the structure, I translated it into wireframes to
              define how each screen connects. The goal was to keep everything
              minimal and functional while highlighting the core interaction:
              the conversation.
              <br /><br />
              I experimented with different layouts to make sure the chat
              interface remained the focal point, with quick access to insights,
              summaries, and recent transactions. This stage allowed me to
              confirm the balance between information and simplicity before
              moving to high-fidelity design.

                Finance can often feel overwhelming, so I aimed to make the

                soft colors, rounded shapes, and clean typography to build trust
                and focus. Spacing and hierarchy were carefully adjusted to make
                information easy to scan and understand. <br /><br />
                The overall visual direction was designed to give users a sense
                of comfort and control, encouraging them to track their finances
